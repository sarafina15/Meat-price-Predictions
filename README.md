Agricultural Pricing Transparency and Data-Driven Solutions This project focuses on addressing inefficiencies, price volatility, and lack of transparency within the agricultural supply chain, particularly in the meat industry. The goal is to enhance price transparency, enable real-time data sharing, and foster data-driven pricing strategies for producers, wholesalers, and retailers. By implementing these solutions, stakeholders can access critical market insights to set competitive and fair prices, improving supply chain efficiency.The project aims to support policy decisions related to agricultural subsidies, price regulations, and consumer protection through clearer pricing data and improved market understanding. A specific focus is placed on the events in the beef industry in 2015, offering valuable context for broader trends in pricing structures and market dynamics.
